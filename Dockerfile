# for a more release-y image, this would be the right way to go. But it does slow down development
# so I copy just what is required for the build commands
# COPY . /task-tracker

# js dependencies
COPY package.json yarn.lock /task-tracker/
RUN yarn install
# TODO consider how much of this could be run on a different / dedicated container
# Later symlink /tmp/node_packages to wherever they are needed
# TODO How would I mount a volume to contain the download caches for yarn / pip to speed up image creation?
# TODO consider how I would update the lock file? Some clever use of docker cp perhaps?

# py dependencies
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock /task-tracker/
RUN pip3 install poetry \
    && poetry run pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel pip \
    && poetry install

# TODO find a way to cache downloaded packages (os, python, yarn) so image rebuilds can use those caches
# maybe use VOLUME @see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#volume ?
# maybe use experimental --mount features 
# @see https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/frontend/dockerfile/docs/experimental.md
