# TODO consider how much of this could be run on a different / dedicated container
# Later symlink /tmp/node_packages to wherever they are needed
# TODO How would I mount a volume to contain the download caches for yarn / pip to speed up image creation?

# TODO find a way to cache downloaded packages (os, python, yarn) so image rebuilds can use those caches
# maybe use VOLUME @see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#volume ?
# maybe use experimental --mount features 
# @see https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/frontend/dockerfile/docs/experimental.md
