    # Currently the entire project directory is exposed into the docker container as
    # a volume -- so any changes to code will be reflected in the container. (also
    # all build output of container will spill out into the project directory :-/) 
    #
    # A good idea for the future would be to only expose sources via a volume
    # into the container so that all build output remains isolated within the
    # container.
